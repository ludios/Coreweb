<div id="doc">
This page verifies that the value you write to a cookie may be changed
by other processes writing to the cookie at the same time.

As of 2010-03-07, this is applicable to Chrome/Chromium and IE8. It may
apply to Firefox 4.0 if it implements multi-process tabs.

Opera note: If you open this page in two tabs in Opera 9.64 or 10.50 on
Windows, you will see some incredibly strange behavior. The tab that is
*not* focused will *always* (or almost?) get an inconsistent read. It's
as if Opera is lying to it about storing the cookie. On Mac OS X 10.6 and
Opera 10.10, the non-active tab doesn't have this problem (although
there are still some bad reads.)

Chrome on XP note: An focused tab that has a 0% bad read rate, may get a
much higher bad read rate when unfocused. But strangely this seems to
depend on which tab. This behavior might be due to XP scheduling
foreground windows at higher priority.

IE8 on XP note: IE8 on XP (maybe on Vista/Win7 too sometimes?) will
often only use 2-3 processes, even if more tabs are open. You might see
unusual behavior: If you have 3 tabs open to this page, 2 of them will
occasionally get bad reads, while the third never does.

Load this page with ?localStorage to use localStorage instead of
cookies.

(?sessionStorage works too, but sessionStorage is useless for us,
because it is not shared accross tabs in most/all browsers.)
