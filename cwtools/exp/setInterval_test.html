Does the browser historically run all the setIntervals it should have run,
after the computer wakes up from sleep?<br><br>

Firefox 3.5/Win: no<br>
Firefox 4/Win: no<br>
IE6/Win: no<br>

</p>

<p>This seems like a good design choice for browsers, because many
webpages use setInterval, and running some function a million times
after the computer wakes up from sleep could be disastrous.</p>

Copied from goog/timer/timer.js:

    // IMPORTANT!
    // window.setInterval in FireFox has a bug - it fires based on
    // absolute time, rather than on relative time. What this means
    // is that if a computer is sleeping/hibernating for 24 hours
    // and the timer interval was configured to fire every 1000ms,
    // then after the PC wakes up the timer will fire, in rapid
    // succession, 3600*24 times.
    // This bug is described here and is already fixed, but it will
    // take time to propagate, so for now I am switching this over
    // to setTimeout logic.

function blah() {
	document.body.innerHTML += new Date().getTime() + '<br>'
}

setInterval(blah, 1000);
