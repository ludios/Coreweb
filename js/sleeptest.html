Does the browser historically run all the setIntervals it should have run,
after the computer wakes up from sleep?<br><br>

Firefox 3.5/Win: no<br>
Firefox 4/Win: no<br>
IE6/Win: no<br>

</p>

<p>This seems like a good design choice for browsers, because many
webpages use setInterval, and running some function a million times
after the computer wakes up from sleep could be disastrous.</p>

<script>

function blah() {
	document.body.innerHTML += new Date().getTime() + '<br>'
}

setInterval(blah, 1000);

</script>
