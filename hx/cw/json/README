General notes
=============

Along with a few good changes, I made a bunch of useless changes that
probably broke things.  See the official hxJson2, which is probably far
better:

Running the tests
=================

In your browser, load /exp/json_flash_tests.html on the coreweb_site server.

Note that there may be problems using ExternalInterface if the tests are run
from a local folder (file://) instead of a server.



JSON decoders notes
===================

I haven't been testing the JSON decoder, so it might have bugs.  It may
also be too slow for use in Flash.  If you want to speed it up, see:

More TODO for the decoder:

Accept more types of whitespace?

License
=======

See /Coreweb/LICENSE.txt



Compatibility
=============

I only tested this with haXe's Flash output.  Neko, PHP, etc,
probably won't work.
