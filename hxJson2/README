=== How to test the code ===

./compile.sh
open "index_flash9.html" in any browser that has Flash player plugin installed

If you want to use ExternalInterface to trace problems, you can't test off of
the local filesystem. You'll need to run a webserver. Twisted makes it easy:

twistd -n web -p 50000 --path .

=== Lack of testing outside of Flash ===

Non-Flash output modes (php, neko, etc) have *not* been tested.
If you run into problems, they are likely bugs.
